# GraphicsEditor
In this project, we wrote a software which can edit pictures. This GUI of this GraphicsEditor was developed by Qt5 in QtCreator, and
the part of image processing was implemented by using OpenCV3.2.

There are some basic functions in this GraphicsEditor. We can use the GraphicsEditor to adjust the brightness, contrast, size or format
of a digit image. Besides, we can change the style of a photo by using filters.

The architectural pattern of this software is Model–view–viewmodel(MVVM). We separate view layer development and application development
to make the efficiency of our team better because each programmer can focus on his own field.
